Net overall_FSM/game_controller/mole/gen_location/rand_reg_reg[8]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin overall_FSM/game_controller/mole/gen_location/rand_reg_reg[8]_LDC_i_1/O, cell overall_FSM/game_controller/mole/gen_location/rand_reg_reg[8]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
